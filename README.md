# CMS Version 1.0.1
Finally! I have re-developed this basic CMS to be WAY more developer friendly and modifiable.

[The Seacry Team](https://t.me/seacry-love).

Benefits of using this CMS:
1) Desined and developed specifically for developers / programmers.
2) Super light weight, the entire system is less than 50kb!
3) Is SEO friendly with clean URLs and some meta tags already incuded.
4) Loads within 0.3 second - tested @ https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.webdeveloprz.com%2F&tab=desktop
5) Includes a simple front-end, HTML & CSS I have given you to start with.
6) Also includes five pages to get you started.
7) Easy to navigate files and folders for modification.
8) Almost completely commented out so you can see how it all works.
9) Has some security in place to get you started.
10) AND, AS A BONUS, it is dynamic page template ready!

With a hope that the good people in the development community will help make it even better.
Feel free to add or request changes to improve this for the masses.
