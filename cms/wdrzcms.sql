In the root/page/images folder you can find the screenshot of the database I created so you can build it as I did...
Then copy and paste the SQL code below to create the home page

INSERT INTO `pages` (`id`, `linklabel`, `pagetitle`, `description`, `pagebody`)
VALUES (NULL, 'Home', 'WebDeveloprz Custom CMS For PWA\'s',
'WebDeveloprz Custom Content Management System For Websites & Progressive Web Applications',
'This is the page body! You can put anything you want here using just text or add <strong><u>HTML</u></strong> as desired ;)')
